Welcome to my website, in keep with the fact that I'm a quirky sort of individual I aim to keep the content of this blog equally novel.

The contents of the site mostly concerns itself with front-end web-development, __JavaScript__ and __AngularJS__. That might not be for you, it's not for everyone, think Marmite, Personalised Number Plates or the Conservative party.

This site has been split into tags, of which a complete list can be found [here](/tags). If you're a non-developer who's still interested in technology these are the relevant tags.
