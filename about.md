Welcome to my website, in keeping with the fact that I'm a quirky sort of individual I aim to keep the content of this blog equally novel.

This site concerns itself with front-end web-development, __JavaScript__ and __AngularJS__. That might not be for you, it's not for everyone.

I have split the site into tags, of which a complete list can be found [here](/tags).

#About Me

I'm a JavaScript developer with over 8 years of industry experience.

As of __11/08/2015__ I'm looking for work as an AngularJS contractor. Please get in touch if you have any positions that you think might be of interest.

You can download my CV here and my LinkedIn profile there.
