<div class="post-list"><h2><a class="post-link" href="http://pegr.ouinon.co/">Pegr</a></h2></div>

Pegr is the first project I've published using Node.js alongside Apache. The site uses a proxy to pass cookies from Cloudant, a CouchDB service. It's purpose is to turn words into numbers with the [Mnemonic Major System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system).

<div class="post-list"><h2><a class="post-link" href="http://ouinon.github.io/stablegrid/">Stable Grid</a></h2></div>

Bootstrap's great but I don't using their 'floating' templates, I built Stablegrid as a boilerplate to build web.cv, it relies upon angular-ui for some of it's functionality. A lite version of Stable-grid can be found [here](http://blog.ouinon.co/stablegrid-lite/#/).
